        p Next year we’ll see the biggest shift of power from Westminster to the West Midlands ever seen. That’s because in May 2017 the people of the West Midlands will choose a Metro Mayor for the region.
        p We think it’s time to create a plan that sets out the changes we want to see, whether that’s making the region richer, fairer, greener or better connected.

                  p Choosing the right metro mayor – one with a clear understanding of what we want for the West Midlands – will make a massive difference.
                  p The new mayor will not only control big budgets within the region, they’ll also play a big role in championing the West Midlands outside of the region.

                 p The West Midlands is a place of opportunity and enterprise, with a proud tradition of trade, manufacturing and innovation. But it lacks good jobs, affordable homes, good transport and long-term investment.
                 p The People’s Plan is about identifying the big challenges we all agree need tackling.

               .content
                 p The People’s Plan has been started by Liam Byrne, MP for Hodge Hill in Birmingham.
                 p It’s not a party political initiative, however. It will involve trade union, community groups and as many people as possible from all parties and none.
